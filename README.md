# IBMDataScienceCertificateFinalProject
Final Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Certificate

Taking a real-world dataset of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches and creating machine learning models to predict whether the launch had a successful landing or not. The project included the webscraping and SQL queries to collect data, data wrangling to get a cleaned and organized dataset, exploratory data analysis, and finally making machine learning models to make predictions on the outcome of launches based on the launch data.
